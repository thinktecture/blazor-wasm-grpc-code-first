# Blazor WebAssembly with gRPC & gRPC-Web

These are samples and demos for conference sessions on using Blazor WASM with gRPC.

With Blazor WebAssembly, developers can write C# code for SPAs in the browser and share code with the server-side of their applications. Usually, you design and use JSON-based Web APIs to communicate between the client and the server logic. In this session, Christian Weyer demonstrates how to employ gRPC & gRPC-Web in a code-first manner to share .NET interface contracts in a strongly-typed way. With this approach, no code generation is needed, you get the same syntax and full intellisense on both sides.

In fact, you gain the good parts we already had many years ago with WCF - now for the ubiquitous & open web.
